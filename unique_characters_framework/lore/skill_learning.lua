--SKILL LEARNING
--[[
Making most crafts dependant on character requires some powerful options for unlocking new crafts (otherwise it's kill the character to get new stuff)

exile_awards applies this for crafting (and might be able to apply this more broadly)


Three Types of Learning:
1) Have the capacity but lack the knowledge: "Oh why didn't I think of that!"
2) Have the knowledge but Lack the capacity: "I have no idea how to make that!"
3) Lack the capacity and lack the knowledge: "Huh?"

Learning Type 1 could come from instantly from mere discovery.
Learning Type 2 would require training.
Learning Type 3 would require discovery then training (becomes Type 2)


Ideas:
Multiplayer - skill transfer from other players:
  Time spent around them has a probability of transfering some skills.
  High chance of getting Type 1 if you see them use it.
  Type 3s become type 2s if you see them use it.
  Slowly aquire type 2s if you see them use it.

Skill books:
  but only usuable by scholars (or characters who are likely to be able to read).
  Such characters might also write them.
  Get Type 1s.
  Make progress to Type 2.
  Make Type 3 a Type 2

Artifact Mind-download machine:
  a chair you sit in, insert a mystery disc then get zapped.
  Now you know what was on the disc, and/or now you have brain damage.

Interacting with item (see exile_awards):
  Seeing it is enough to teach you how to make it.
  e.g. "See (e.g. pick it up)" -> Type 1 = "I could do that" -> unlock
              -> Type 2 = progress to understanding it
              -> Type 3 ->Type 2...
              Items could be found in ruins, past character's bones, undercity.

Aquiring Type 2/3 implies mere grind:
  Generally dislike encouraging grind.
  Needs to be done in a way that doesn't make people sit there pointlessly making 100000 hats to unlock "Advanced Hat Making"
