Exile mod: Lore
=============================
Story elements, such as character backgrounds and unique crafts

DEVELOPMENT VERSION:
This is testing a framework for making unique characters a fundamental part of the game.
It has enough content to see how this might work in practice
Some aspects could be okay to cherry pick out and merge into the game, others are experimental - these are playable but unbalanced/incomplete/demonstration only.

The unique crafts element (especially in combo with exile awards)

Might be possible to merge (i.e. it shouldn't break anything!):
- character story generation (char_core, char_history, exile letter) (note: Still a bit rough might need further improvement)
- other tidying up, improvement (login)
- many of the unique crafts themselves (should be moved to Tech or wherever is appropriate). However might not want to make them available to players yet? - they are based on the assumption only some characters get them.


Future:
- This has highlighted what will be needed to make unique characters a coherent core element of the game
- Also highlights some pitfalls if it is done poorly
- will require working exile_awards skills through out the game.
- also would benefit from many other ways of working characters traits through the game
- Health mod overhaul is needed to add unique physical traits.
